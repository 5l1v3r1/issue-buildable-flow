# Issue Contributor :zap:
This is a simple flow made on Buildable, fetches the user that created the issue, the GitHub action runs and adds the user to the README file.

## How to add yourself to the README?
<ol>
  <li>Create an issue</li>
  <li>Wait for the GitHub action to make api call</li>
  <li>Buildable Flow will run and add you to the README! ðŸŽ‰</li>
</ol>

> **Create your own flow at [Buildable.dev](https://buildable.dev)**
